Hello! I am an Applied Research Scientist at [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/about). Previously, I was a Senior Research Scientist at [Megagon Labs](https://megagon.ai) (2017-2022), a Visiting Scientist at [the Human Dynamics Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/human-dynamics/overview/), [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) (2014-2016), and a Research Scientist at [NTT Laboratories](https://www.ntt.co.jp/RD/e/index.html) (2008-2014). I received my B.E., M.E, and Ph.D. (Dr. Eng.) respectively from [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/), Japan.

My research interest has been lying in the intersection of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Data Management. I also work on computational approaches for the social sciences known as Computational Social Science.

My current research scope can be categorized as follows:
- Text Summarization/Generation [[ACL Findings 2022]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07520) [[EMNLP Findings 2021]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.328/) [[TACL 2021]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.tacl-1.17/) [[ACL 2020]](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.513/)
- Table Understanding [[SIGMOD 2022]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01785) [[VLDB 2021]](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p50-li.pdf) [[VLDB 2020]](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p1835-zhang.pdf)
- Information/Knowledge Extraction [[WWW 2021]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00119.pdf) [[NAACL 2019]](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1239/)

I'm a [ramen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen) enthusiast.

FAQ
======
- Q. Are you [the famous green dinosaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi)?  
A. No. I'm not working with [the famous Italian plumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario), 
but both of us are originally from Japan. Yoshi means "good" in Japanese, and my full first name Yoshihiko means "a good boy", 
which well describes myself. :)

- Q. What is your favorite ramen place?  
A. Please contact me for my private list of the best ramen places. :)
