Hi! I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Megagon Labs](https://megagon.ai). Previously, I was a Visiting Scientist at [the Human Dynamics Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/human-dynamics/overview/), [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) (2014-2016), 
and a Research Scientist at [NTT Laboratories](https://www.ntt.co.jp/RD/e/index.html) (2008-2014). I received my B.E., M.E, and Ph.D. (Dr. Eng.) respectively from [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/), Japan.

My recent research focus is at the intersection of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Data Management. I also work on computational approaches for the social sciences (known as Computational Social Science.)

I'm a [ramen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen) enthusiast.

FAQ
======
- Q. Are you [the famous green dinosaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi)?  
A. No. I'm not working with [the famous Italian plumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario), 
but both of us are originally from Japan. Yoshi means "good" in Japanese, and my full first name Yoshihiko means "a good boy", 
which well describes myself. :)

- Q. What is your favorite ramen place?  
A. Please contact me for my private list of the best ramen places. :)
